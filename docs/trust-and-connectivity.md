# Trust Model & Connectivity

Reference notes for `contacts.rs`, `trust.rs`, `connectivity.rs`, and the NAT
fields on `IdentityAnnouncement` / `DiscoveredAgent`.

## Trust Model (`contacts.rs`, `trust.rs`)

Each agent maintains a `ContactStore` of known peers with:

- `TrustLevel`: Blocked | Unknown | Known | Trusted
- `IdentityType`: Anonymous | Known | Trusted | Pinned
- `MachineRecord`: Tracks machine IDs an agent has been observed running on

`TrustEvaluator` evaluates `(AgentId, MachineId)` pairs against the store:
1. Blocked → `RejectBlocked`
2. `Pinned` identity type + wrong machine → `RejectMachineMismatch`
3. `Pinned` identity type + right machine → `Accept`
4. `TrustLevel::Trusted` → `Accept`
5. `TrustLevel::Known` → `AcceptWithFlag`
6. Not in store → `Unknown`

The identity listener applies trust evaluation to every incoming announcement. Blocked and machine-mismatched announcements are silently dropped.

## Connectivity (`connectivity.rs`)

`ReachabilityInfo` summarises how reachable a discovered agent is:
- `should_attempt_direct()`: true if we have at least one address AND `can_receive_direct` is not explicitly `false`. Unknown reachability still gets a direct probe.
- `needs_coordination()`: true if `can_receive_direct == Some(false)` (e.g. symmetric NAT)
- `likely_direct()`: true only when `can_receive_direct == Some(true)` — peer has verified direct inbound connectivity

`Agent::connect_to_agent(agent_id)` strategy:
1. Look up agent in discovery cache → `NotFound` if absent
2. No addresses → `Unreachable`
3. `should_attempt_direct()` → try `network.connect_addr()` for each address → `Direct(addr)` on success
4. `needs_coordination()` or direct failed → for each reachable coordinator peer: connect to coordinator, then use `network.connect_peer_via(peer_id, coordinator)` for peer-ID hole-punching (QUIC extension frames, PUNCH_ME_NOW) → `Coordinated(addr)` on success
5. All attempts failed → `Unreachable`

The coordination path uses explicit peer-ID-based NAT traversal via `connect_peer_via` (which calls `connect_to_peer(peer_id, Some(coordinator))`), not raw `connect_addr`. This triggers QUIC extension-frame hole-punching through the coordinator peer (typically a bootstrap node). MASQUE relay fallback is planned but not yet wired in ant-quic.

Successful connections enrich the bootstrap cache via `add_from_connection()`.

## Enhanced Announcements (`lib.rs`, `network.rs`)

`IdentityAnnouncement` and `DiscoveredAgent` carry four optional NAT fields:
- `nat_type: Option<String>` — e.g. "FullCone", "Symmetric", "None"
- `can_receive_direct: Option<bool>` — whether inbound connections are accepted
- `is_relay: Option<bool>` — whether the node is relaying for others
- `is_coordinator: Option<bool>` — whether the node is coordinating NAT punch timing

The sync `build_announcement()` leaves these as `None` (no network access). The async heartbeat queries `NetworkNode::node_status()` to populate them.

**Protocol note**: These fields use bincode 1.x serialization. Old→new messages will fail to decode because bincode 1.x treats every field as required. This is a deliberate protocol version bump.
