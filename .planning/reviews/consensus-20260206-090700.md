### MEDIUM: 0
### LOW: 0

**Perfect implementation.**

## Task Specification Compliance

All acceptance criteria from PLAN-phase-2.3.md Task 5 met:

- ✅ Matrix includes ubuntu (x64-gnu, x64-musl, arm64)
- ✅ Matrix includes macos (x64, arm64)
- ✅ Matrix includes windows (x64)
- ✅ Uses cross-compilation where needed (musl, arm64)
- ✅ Artifacts uploaded for each platform

## Implementation Quality

**Excellent Features:**
- 6-platform build matrix (all required platforms)
- Conditional cross-compilation (matrix.cross flag)
- Platform-specific caching (includes target in keys)
- fail-fast: false (allows all builds to complete)
- if-no-files-found: error (catches silent build failures)
- Clear artifact naming (x0x-$platform)
- Proper macOS runner selection (macos-13 for x64, macos-14 for arm64)

## Recommendation

**APPROVE AND MERGE**

Implementation covers all required platforms. No changes needed.

## Next Steps

1. Commit changes
2. Continue to Task 6 (Add WASM Build to Build Matrix)
