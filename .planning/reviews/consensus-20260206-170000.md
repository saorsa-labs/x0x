## Situation Analysis

The review workflow was invoked for "Task 6" but upon inspection:

1. **Task 6 is already complete**: Commit 582cb68 "feat(phase-1.2): task 6 - implement message passing"
2. **No uncommitted changes**: `git diff HEAD src/network.rs` shows no changes
3. **Phase 1.2 is complete**: STATE.json shows phase 1.2 completed with all 11 tasks done
4. **Currently on Phase 1.3**: STATE.json shows current phase is 1.3 "Gossip Overlay Integration"

### What Was Reviewed

The review agents analyzed:
- Latest commit: "implement join_network()" (Phase 1.3 work in src/lib.rs)
- error-handling.md found CRITICAL issues in join_network() method
- But this is NOT Task 6 from Phase 1.2

### Task 6 Actual Status

**Commit 582cb68** implemented:
- `send_message(&self, peer_id: &PeerId, message: &Message)`
- `receive_message(&self)`
- Both methods properly serialize/deserialize Message
- Uses ant-quic's send()/recv() for transport

**Tests**: 281/281 passing (verified just now)
**Warnings**: Zero
**Build**: Clean

---

## Recommendation

**PASS - Task 6 Complete**

Task 6 from Phase 1.2 was properly implemented, reviewed, and committed. The work is done.

**Next Action**: The GSD workflow should:
1. Recognize Phase 1.2 is complete (11/11 tasks)
2. Transition to Phase 1.3
3. Handle the CRITICAL error in `join_network()` as part of Phase 1.3 work

---

## Note on join_network() Issues

The error-handling review correctly identified CRITICAL issues in `join_network()` from the latest commit:
- Error type mismatch (returns Result<(), IdentityError> but calls NetworkResult operations)
- Silent failure when all bootstrap peers fail
- No error aggregation

These issues are real but belong to Phase 1.3, not Phase 1.2 Task 6.
