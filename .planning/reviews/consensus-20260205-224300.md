## Key Strengths

1. **Cryptographic Implementation**: Industry-standard ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD from well-audited crate. Provides both confidentiality and authenticity.

2. **Security Documentation**: Critical nonce reuse warning prominently documented. Authentication failure scenarios clearly explained.

3. **Proper AEAD Usage**: Authenticated encryption with additional data (AAD) correctly implemented. Authentication tag verified on decryption.

4. **Test Coverage**: 13 comprehensive tests covering all requirements, security properties, and edge cases. 232/232 tests pass.

5. **Error Handling**: Clean error propagation with descriptive messages. Different error types for encryption vs decryption failures.

6. **Code Quality**: Simple, readable implementation. Minimal complexity. Helper method for nonce derivation (DRY principle).

7. **Spec Compliance**: All task requirements met. Implementation exceeds specification with comprehensive testing and documentation.

8. **Type Safety**: No unsafe operations. Proper use of library types. Clear ownership semantics.
